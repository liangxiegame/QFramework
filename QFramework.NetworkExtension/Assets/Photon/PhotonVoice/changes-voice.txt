   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 6306
   FIXED: NullReferenceException when Recorder.StopRecordingWhenPaused is enabled as Recorder.HandleApplicationPause was trying to start recording without checking if it should.
   FIXED: [WebRtcAudioDsp.AEC] NullReferenceException when WebRtcAudioDsp.AEC is enabled (introduced in previous version where we subscribe to AudioOutCapture event before we initialize AEC in WebRTCAudioProcessor).
   FIXED: [iOS] resets audio session category to defaults values (CategoryAmbient, ModeDefault, CategoryOptionMixWithOthers) on cleanup (so you can set volume to zero for instance when app is closed).
   FIXED: VoiceConnection.OnRemoteVoiceInfo() was setting the output handler for the remote stream even if the codec was not Opus, this prevented video component sharing this connection from handling the stream.
   ADDED: [Logging] voice networking client's operation response errors (e.g. when join voice room fails).
   ADDED: [WebRtcAudioDsp.AEC] WebRtcAudioDsp.AecOnlyWhenEnabled: as the name implies AEC will be used only when component isActiveAndEnabled (default true).
   CHANGED: [WebRtcAudioDsp.AEC] refactoring started in previous version should be done.
   ADDED: minor, WebRtcAudioDsp.IsInitialized (simple null check for internal processor class).

   CHANGED: [WebRtcAudioDsp.AEC] the getter now returns actual state of AEC when the WebRtcAudioDsp is initialized. 
   CHANGED: [WebRtcAudioDsp.AEC] when disabled, AudioOutCapture is auto destroyed if it was created by WebRtcAudioDsp.

v2.28 (November 10th, 2021)
   PUN2: v2.39 (3d2cb9e) [RT/lib:4.1.6.10]
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 6268
   FIXED: passing correct default Photon microphone ID (-1 instead of -128).
   FIXED: compilation in 2021.2+ due to namespace change.
   FIXED: crash in macOS when device changes due to Unity API call from non main thread by adding internal Recorder.MicrophoneDeviceChangeDetected flag & restarting recording from VoiceConnection.

   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 6245
   FIXED: [Android] removed Camera permission added in previous version.
   FIXED: background thread name length due to some constraints in some platform.
   FIXED: [logging] minor, log level used for PhotonVoiceApi's AudioSyncBuffer classes: debug instead of info. (this will avoid 'underrun' / 'overrun' Speaker log noise/spam)

v2.27 (October 06th, 2021)
   PUN2: v2.37 (a9f7ce2) [RT/lib:4.1.6.7]
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 6226

   CHANGED: [BREAKING] Voice.AudioInEnumerator code changed, some methods and a property were removed.
   REMOVED: [BREAKING] obsolete method Recorder.Init(VoiceClient, Object).
   FIXED: Speaker.OnRemoteVoiceInfo (linking) return value (Initialized & either (should not start playback OR playbak started).
   ADDED: Recorder.PhotonMicrophoneDeviceIdString in UWP/WSA context as ID is string in this case and not int.
   ADDED: generic unified Recorder.MicrophoneDevice to get or set microphone device (using enumerator via Recorder.MicrophonesEnumerator) no matter the microphone type.
   CHANGED: Recorder.PhotonMicrophoneEnumerator is now obsolete, use the new generic unified non-static Recorder.MicrophonesEnumerator which works for all microphone types even Unity one.
   ADDED: Unity.AudioInEnumerator as Unity microphone type devices can now have its own enumerator (wrapper around UnityEnginer.Microphone.devices)

   CHANGED: Recorder.AutoStart won't happen if recorder was previously stopped explicitly using Recorder.StopRecording().
   CHANGED: Recorder.AutoStart will cause recording to start if set to true and conditions are met.
   FIXED: warning due to auto start recording attempt when it's not expected.
   CHANGED: Speaker playback is now handled via Service calls inside VoiceConnection.Update for linked speakers only. (used to be via coroutine inside Speaker itself) This fixes playback when Speaker is not enabled or not active in the hierarchy and Speaker.PlaybackOnlyWhenEnabled is false.
   FIXED: inverted condition in Speaker.StartPlaying which could cause playback to not start.
   ADDED: [MAJOR CHANGE] Recorder.RecordOnlyWhenJoined and all necessary code. Default is true. The recorder's AutoStart will be 'delayed' so PUN integration (PhotonVoiceView has time to set recorder.UserData) and permission request work properly.
   FIXED: [DemoVoiceUI] potential NullReferenceException in RemoteSpeakerUI.OnDestroy.
   ADDED: [Editor only] VoiceConnection and PhotonVoiceNetwork inspector will display asset version info on top. Unfold it to get Photon Voice version, etc.

   PUN2: v2.20.2 (24c76182)
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 5698
   CHANGED: delayed Speaker initialization until speaker is linked (once/the first time). This was necessary for PlayStation to be able to set UserID before playback start, but we chose to apply to all platforms.
   ADDED: [Logging] info log entries when subscribing and unsubscribing from audio config/device changes callbacks.
   FIXED: [PlayStation] Speaker.PlayStationUserID set before Speaker initialization. This fix is good unlike previous ones.
